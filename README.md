# Flight-Stick
Hopefully building an F-14 Flightstick that I can use with my computer... even tho I probably won't use it... Could be fun?

_This Project is a part of Hackclub's YSWS 'Highway to Hardware'_

Step 1.
First step is finding out how Flightsticks actually work, primarily computer based ones, although flight-sticks from inside planes could provide useful information.
 - Part 1
    - Watching Youtube videos and reading articles on the function of Flightsticks, as I watch them I'll put them here if they're useful.
 - Part 2
    - Reading through the Reddit Forum for Diy Flightsticks : r/HotasDIY ... I should probably learn what a Hotas actually is...

Step 2.
Next, I need to consider the hardware I will need: likely including springs, maybe a gyro, definitely a joystick, and an arduino to convert the inputs from the joystick into usable inputs by my computer
 - Part 1
    - Find Youtube videos of people who have actually manufactured their own Flightsticks, see what parts they use.
 - Part 2
    - Ask questions on the r/HotasDIY subreddit, and hope I get solid answers

Step 3.
I need to 3D model and prepare parts for the flightstick, so that I can obtain a grant for their production.
 - Part 1
    - Since I am attempting to make a replica Flightstick, I need to find reference imagery of the F-14's cockpit assembly, whilst I can probably eyeball it from images and scenes from 'Top Gun - Maverick' lol, it's generally a better idea to try and find engineering drawings with measurements.
    - Due to an old attempt _unsuccessful_ to create a keypad, I have an understanding of how to use KiCad, so I will look into what kind of ports and arduino chips to use in the design of the controller.
 - Part 2
    - I've participated in the F1 in Schools competition multiple times, as the design engineer, so I have access, and the ability to use the free Student Edition of Autodesk's Fusion, I'll use this to do my creation phase of the design
    - I'll use KiCad to design the controller for the Flightstick

Step 4.
Finish this all in 3 weeks. Oh dear...
