# Flight-Stick
Hopefully building an F-14 Flightstick that I can use with my computer... even tho I probably won't use it... Could be fun?

_This Project is a part of Hackclub's YSWS 'Highway to Hardware'_

Step 1.
First step is finding out how Flightsticks actually work, primarily computer based ones, although flight-sticks from inside planes could provide useful information.
 - Part 1
    - Watching Youtube videos and reading articles on the function of Flightsticks, as I watch them I'll put them here if they're useful.
       - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg8l7W0TuPg This video explains how to make a Joystick Gimbal - an important component
       - https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Bluetooth-or-USB-HOTAS-Game-Controller/ This article is a tutorial for how to build a Flightstick which gives useful insights into the manufacturing
       - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-rc98z1Gxc I can't find a materials list, but this video shows how the triggers and buttons can be assembled
 - Part 2
    - Reading through the Reddit Forum for Diy Flightsticks : r/HotasDIY ... I should probably learn what a Hotas actually is...
       - I've found now that a HOTAS stands for Hands On Throttle And Stick, as opposed to HOSAS, which means Hands On Stick And Stick, which uses two sticks for more axes 

Step 2.
Next, I need to consider the hardware I will need: likely including springs, maybe a gyro, definitely a joystick, and an arduino to convert the inputs from the joystick into usable inputs by my computer
 - Part 1
    - Find Youtube videos of people who have actually manufactured their own Flightsticks, see what parts they use.
 - Part 2
    - Ask questions on the r/HotasDIY subreddit, and hope I get solid answers

Step 3.
Now I need to move onto finding how to make the throttle lever, and since I'm using an F-14,  the throttle also needs to have the wing-fold lever, because that's cool :)
 - Part 1
    - Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the throttle lever system
  
Step 4.
I need to 3D model and prepare parts for the flightstick, so that I can obtain a grant for their production.
 - Part 1
    - Since I am attempting to make a replica Flightstick, I need to find reference imagery of the F-14's cockpit assembly, whilst I can probably eyeball it from images and scenes from 'Top Gun - Maverick' lol, it's generally a better idea to try and find engineering drawings with measurements.
    - Due to an old attempt _unsuccessful_ to create a keypad, I have an understanding of how to use KiCad, so I will look into what kind of ports and arduino chips to use in the design of the controller.
 - Part 2
    - I've participated in the F1 in Schools competition multiple times, as the design engineer, so I have access, and the ability to use the free Student Edition of Autodesk's Fusion, I'll use this to do my creation phase of the design
    - I'll use KiCad to design the controller for the Flightstick

Step 5.
Model a replica of the F-14 throttle section.
    - Similar to some company-produced flightsticks that come with a throtte system, I will make the assembly able to be split into each part, and put an arduino in each segment, and have 2 inputs to my pc, which is harder to use, but easier to set up, or I can put a slave arduino in the throttle, and a master in the flightstick and connect them with one wire,         which is harder to set up, but easier to use

Step 6. 
Prototype using my 3D printer, and make changes.

Step 6.
Finish this all by July 31st. Oh dear...
