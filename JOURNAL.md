F-14 Tomcat Computer Flightstick and HOTAS
Brought to you by Joel Harwood
This is a project for Highway to Hardware, where I am going to design and hopefully manufacture a full HOTAS (Hands on Throttle And Stick) assembly
This project was officially started (it's been a brainworm for like 3 months) on the 11/07/2025, using DD/MM/YYYY format
