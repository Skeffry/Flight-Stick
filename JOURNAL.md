Computer Flightstick and HOTAS

Brought to you by Joel Harwood

This is a project for Highway to Hardware, where I am going to design and hopefully manufacture a full HOTAS (Hands on Throttle And Stick) assembly

This project was officially started (it's been a brainworm for like 3 months) on the 11/07/2025, using DD/MM/YYYY format

**Github Repository is set up, and research has begun.**

This day's focus was on getting the Github repo set up, and adding it to the Hackclub 'Highway to Hardware', then once I completed the repo, I begun working through the steps I laid out in the README. This meant I went through and researched how flightsticks work, which I did by watching videos and reading articles on how people have made their own DIY HOTAS setups. I also asked a question on the r/HotasDIY subreddit about tips on how to make my own flightstick. However, I mainly focused on the creation of **flightsticks**, so my next session I will focus on the manufacturing of the throttle systems.
Here's a list of some things I found:
  - Most DIY flightsticks use 2 rotary encoders, one on each axis pivot of a gimbal, to read the x/y direction changes of the flightstick.
  - For the lever triggers on the flightstick, you can use limit switches and springs, or simple buttons for a more quick action press.
  - Interestingly, for a second 'joystick' on the top of the flightstick, I've seen someone use 4 buttons and springs for a simple input closer to a WASD input than a joystick.
  - 3D printing all of the parts is definitely possible, but I could also get them properly manufactured, although I probably won't, except for the internal framing, for which I might use metal plating that has been machined, for durability
  - The processor can be an ESP32 if I want BlueTooth, or an Arduino Pro Micro for a basic USB device

  - www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-rc98z1Gxc - Here's a yt video that showed some of the parts, including where I say how: a) I can 3D print it, and b) the use of limit switchs, springs, and the use of buttons for the joystick
